The DOT - Email Builder is a specialized tool for creating modular, responsive, and brand-compliant HTML email templates. It is specifically optimized for Power Automate, allowing you to insert dynamic expressions directly into the email structure.

## Interface Overview
The application is divided into two primary sections:
- Left Sidebar (the Editor): Where you add, remove, reorder, and configure your email modules.
- Main Area (the Preview): A live-updating view of your email. You can toggle between Preview (visual) and Export HTML (raw code).
